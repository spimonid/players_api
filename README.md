ðŸŸ¥ import from CBS https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/38c8034e9943e74ccc6d3ffd0c195a3944f11a53/Gemfile#L60 https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/401ae97002443fe8a42abe0bb0be1c2a64390c6c/lib/tasks/initial_import.rake#L6-L10

ðŸŸ¦ persist by [setting up the table](https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/main/db/migrate/20220402132537_add_columns_to_players_table.rb) and saving each record with custom logic on [`name_brief`](https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/main/lib/brief_name_generator.rb) and [`average_position_age_diff`](https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/main/lib/average_position_age_diff_calculator.rb). https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/401ae97002443fe8a42abe0bb0be1c2a64390c6c/lib/tasks/initial_import.rake#L37-L51

ðŸŸ© Routing - an endpoint to show an individual player and a search endpoint https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/401ae97002443fe8a42abe0bb0be1c2a64390c6c/config/routes.rb#L1-L5

## Beside Requirements

### Search bonus
If `feeling_lucky` param is present, returns just the first result of your search, otherwise there could be multiple records in the response
https://github.com/spimonid/players_api/blob/401ae97002443fe8a42abe0bb0be1c2a64390c6c/app/controllers/players_controller.rb#L8-L14

### QA and Testing

Fire up your preferred API testing tool

Run `rails test test/models/player_test.rb` and `rails test test/controllers/players_controller_test.rb`

## A couple things that would come next that I couldn't get to
- Refactoring the search from three `.where`s in a row to something more concise
- More robust testing set up and execution
